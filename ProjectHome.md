Graphin is a 2D graphics rendering library with human readable yet simple external interface (API).

It is based on AGG - high fidelity 2D graphics engine and uses libpng/zlib, jpeglib and libtiff(?).

External (plain C) API is as close as possible to [Graphics](http://terrainformatica.com/sciter/Graphics.whtm) and/or to [Canvas](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Drawing_Graphics_with_Canvas).

In other words: it should be able to implement Canvas alike functionality for any language/environment with relatively small effort by using Graphin.

The intention is to make Graphin as much portable as possible.

Here is a screenshot of the demo application (on Windows):
